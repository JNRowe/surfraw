    and is not debian-specific
  * Makefile.am: Added install-data-hook to create links
  * configure.in, elvi/Makefile.in: fixed ELVIDIR quoting

    generated on build.

    freedb, happypenguin, jake, rhyme, scaleplus, sharereactor
    thesaurus, webster, deblists.
  * Added note to HACKING explaining how to disable ifs quoting
