.SH NAME
surfraw \- a fast unix command line interface to WWW services
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B surfraw
.RI [ options ]\ search_words...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B surfraw 
commands. 
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
It could be incomplete and/or not so up-to-date.
.br
See /usr/share/doc/surfraw/README.gz for documentation.
.br
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBsurfraw\fP provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety
of popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It
reclaims google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
slashdot and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen
lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in
unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

.SH NEW FEATURES
.br
.PP
The elvi now live in a subdirectory that is not in your path
(usually /usr/bin/surfraw-elvi). To access an elvis,
either type "surfraw elviname options searchterms" or
"sr elviname options searchterms".
.PP
To regain the old behaviour, either manually add the directory to your
path, or use surfraw-update-path to add it to your startup files. See
the man page for surfraw-update-path for details
.PP
Surfraw now supports bookmarks. To add a bookmark, add it to
/etc/surfraw.bookmarks or ~/.surfraw.bookmarks
.PP
The format of the bookmarks file is simple, each bookmark is on a
separate line, with the bookmark and URL separated by whitespace, eg:
.PP
ntk   http://www.ntk.net/
.PP
To invoke a bookmark, use "surfraw bookmark" or "sr bookmark", and if
an elvis of that name doesn't exist, it searches for a bookmark of
that name instead.
.PP
There are some example bookmarks in /etc/surfraw.bookmarks
