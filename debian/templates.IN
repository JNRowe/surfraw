Template: surfraw/surfraw-path
Type: note
Description: New layout for surfraw elvi
 Surfraw has been rearranged so the elvi (tools to search websites) are in a separate directory (@ELVIDIR@) and no longer in your path. To run an elvis now, use:
 .
 surfraw elviname [options] searchterms
 .
 sr is an alias for surfraw, so you could do, for example:
 .
 sr google -lucky my 200 monkeys
 .
 If you wish to retain the old behaviour of running elvi directly, use surfraw-update-path(1) to append @ELVIDIR@ to your shell's PATH (or optionally, all users and/or all known shells)
