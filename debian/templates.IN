Description: New layout for surfraw elvi
 Surfraw has been rearranged so the elvi (tools to search websites) are in a separate directory (@ELVIDIR@) and no longer in your path. To run an elvis now, use:
 .
 surfraw elviname [options] searchterms
 .
 sr is an alias for surfraw, so you could do, for example:
 .
 sr google -lucky my 200 monkeys
 .
 If you wish to retain the old behaviour of running elvi directly, use surfraw-update-path(1) to append @ELVIDIR@ to your shell's PATH (or optionally, all users and/or all known shells)

Description: Elvi have moved *again*
 The elvi have moved again to @ELVIDIR@
 .
 If you ran surfaw-update-path when version 2.0-1 was installed, you will
 need to run it again, twice, to update your config files to the new location.
 .
 First run it with -remove, to remove the existing path, then with -add to add
 the new path.
 .
 Remember you will need source your config files (or log out and in again) for this
 to take effect.
