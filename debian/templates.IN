Template: surfraw/surfraw-path
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you want the surfraw elvi directory (@ELVIDIR@) added to the PATH for all shells?
 Surfraw has been rearranged so the elvi (tools to search websites) are in a separate directory and no longer in your path. To run an elvis now, use:
   surfraw elviname [options] searchterms
 sr is an alias for surfraw, so you could do, for example:
   sr google -lucky my 200 monkeys
 .
 If you wish to retain the old behaviour of running elvi directly, use surfraw-update-path(1) to append @ELVIDIR@ to your shell's PATH
 .
 If you wish, you can now configure all (known) shells so they have the elvi in their path.
